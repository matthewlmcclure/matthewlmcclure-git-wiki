# How well does GitHub work as a wiki?

## Using the first class wiki feature

* First-class wiki feature based on Gollum doesn't have search.

## Using a plain repository as a wiki

* Allows finding content via code search.
* <del>Web editor doesn't have preview.</del> As of 2014-03-06, web editor has preview.
* <del>Web editor doesn't have delete.</del> As of 2014-03-06, web editor has delete.

## Images

* Web editor does not handle drag and drop to embed images, nor does the GitHub website provide any way to add an image to a repository. I can still embed an image using Markdown. I just have to host the image somewhere else or add it to the repository via Git.
